# Terrible Sort
An entry for the NJIT Fall 2020 TerribleHackathon.

## Description
This sort is a variant of BogoSort but instead of just using random to sort, it uses
a much more complex (terrible) method to choose random numbers. First it creates a 50X50 matrix by using Conway's Game of Life and running it for 10,000 generations. It then creates another 50X50 matrix generated by a Perlin Noise algorithm. Then it multiplies the two matrices together into a new matrix, and gets the sum of all of the values in the new matrix. It then uses the sum to choose an element in the list to be sorted, and swaps it with another element selected using the same process.
